# productReview

The Product Reviews API allows users to consult and share their opinions about different products. Users can post reviews, rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, and read other users' opinions. The API allows you to manage a list of products, display all reviews for a specific product, and calculate an average rating to help users make informed purchasing decisions.



## Issue

In online commerce, it is common for consumers to seek reviews from other users before deciding to buy a product. However, often the information available is limited, difficult to access or unreliable, which affects the shopping experience and customer satisfaction. In addition, for many sites, review management is limited: they do not allow to organize or filter reviews efficiently, which causes frustration and distrust among users.



## Objectives of the API

The Product Reviews API addresses this issue by enabling users to:

**View detailed reviews:** easily access opinions about the products they wish to purchase.
**Rate products:** Record and view average ratings to get an idea of the quality of each product.
**Share their experiences:** Users can leave feedback to help other consumers and contribute to product reputation.



## Key API Features.

**Product Management:** Product registration with details such as name, description and category.
**Review System:** Registration of reviews with comments, 1 to 5 star ratings, and storage of review date.
**Rating Average:** Calculation and display of the average rating for each product for quick reference.
**Filtering and Sorting:** Ability to sort reviews by rating (from highest to lowest) and to view only the most recent reviews or those of a specific rating.
